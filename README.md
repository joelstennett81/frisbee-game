# frisbee-game
  For this project, I created an ultimate frisbee game to be played on the computer. I am on the ultimate frisbee team here at JBU, and I really enjoy playing it. My original idea was to create a sports game like basketball. However, I wanted to create a frisbee game because I love the game of frisbee, and there are not any frisbee computer games out there. Originally, my plan was to create a text based frisbee game, where the user could choose what happens based on three different options provided by the computer. Whether the action is successful or not is based on probability. I modeled the game based on different video games I have played, namely Madden and NBA 2k. To do this, I wanted to add features where the user could create their own players and teams, as well as simulate or play games. I also wanted  a way for an entire season to be played or simulated. I also wanted to implement a way to keep stats of the games, because I love numbers, and I always appreciate looking at stats of games.
